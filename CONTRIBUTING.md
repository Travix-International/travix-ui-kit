# Contributing Guidelines

Travix welcomes patches/pulls for features and bug fixes on our UI Kit.

If appropriate, write a unit test which demonstrates that your code functions as expected. Tests are the best way to ensure that future contributors do not break your code accidentally.

To request a change or addition, you must submit a pull request.

Travix developers manage the UI Kit's releases, however if you feel there's the need to update UI Kit's version, please create an issue for that which we'll reply or act on it when/if necessary.

Travix developers monitor outstanding pull requests. They may request changes to the pull request before accepting.

The README in the test folder has all the information needed for setting up the development enviroment and how create tests for the demo pages.
